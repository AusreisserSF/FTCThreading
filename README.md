# FTCThreading
 Presentation and sample source code for Java 8 threading in FTC  
 
 The presentation provides background on multi-threading in general and multi-threading in Java 8 in particular. 
 
 Before loading the source code files into your FTC Android Studio project, you must first import the source code or the aaa of the open-source ftcdevcommon library. Please follow the instructions in the README for the Github repository AusreisserSF/FTCDEVCommonAndroid.
 
 The source code in this repository is designed to be copied directly into the TeamCode module of an FTC project for Android Studio. You will see that the Java package for the two source code modules is org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.auto. The file ServoTouchOpMode.java is an autonomous OpMode. The file SwivelServo.java, which is based on FTC external.samples.ConceptScanServo, serves as an illustration of putting the device interaction into a separate class. 
 
 The hardware used in the demo consists of the Rev Robotics Smart Robot Servo and the Rev Robotics Touch Sensor. In ServoTouchOpMode.java you will see what names to use when you configure your robot.
